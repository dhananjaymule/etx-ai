Ensure delayed fencing works by confirming the cluster does not fence immediately after a crash. Test fence\\_kdump separately with: `fence\\_kdump\\_send -p 7410 -i eth0 -m reboot` and check if NMI is working. Monitor fencing logs in /var/log/pacemaker.log for errors.\n```\n\nAfter providing these examples, the GPT model should be able to complete the task instructions without any difficulty."}

This line sets a delay for fencing to happen after a crash, allowing time for kdump to capture and store a dump. The value 60 represents a 1 minute delay in seconds."}

It allows you to specify the hosts that will be monitored by kdump, the host list that will be included in the monitor action, and the monitor action that will be performed when a crash occurs. For example:\n```\nfence\\_kdump\\_nodes pcmk\\_host\\_list=\"node1 node2\" pcmk\\_monitor\\_action=\"metadata\" op monitor interval=30s```"}
